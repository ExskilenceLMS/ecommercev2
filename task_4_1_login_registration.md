# Task 4 – Subtask 4.1: Login & Registration UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **first real UI pages** for your e-commerce app: login and registration forms.  
These are the entry points where users (Admin, Seller, Customer) will access the system.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/base.html` (shared layout for all pages)
- `Development/templates/auth/login.html`
- `Development/templates/auth/register.html`  
- `Development/static/css/style.css` (basic styling)

This creates the foundation for all future UI pages and establishes your visual design system.
