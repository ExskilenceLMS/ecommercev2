# Task 4 – Subtask 4.5: Product Listing & Details UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **Product Listing & Details UI** – the main shopping pages that customers use to browse and view products.  
These are the core pages where customers discover products, search, filter, and see product details.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/product/list.html` – Product catalog with search/filtering
- `Development/templates/product/details.html` – Individual product detail page
- Product grid layout with categories, search bar, sorting options
- Product cards showing image, price, rating, add-to-cart button

This creates the UI foundation for Task 11 (actual Product Listing functionality).
