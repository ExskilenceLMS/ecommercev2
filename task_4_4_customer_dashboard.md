# Task 4 – Subtask 4.4: Customer Dashboard UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **Customer Dashboard UI** – the main panel for regular shoppers.  
This page shows order history, profile info, and shopping-related actions for customers.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/customer/dashboard.html` – Complete customer dashboard
- Dashboard cards showing customer metrics (total orders, total spent, recent activity)
- Quick action buttons for profile, orders, addresses
- Clean, customer-friendly layout matching your design system

This creates the UI foundation for Task 10 (actual Customer Dashboard functionality).
