# Task 4 – Subtask 4.7: Order Confirmation Page UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **Order Confirmation Page UI** – the success page customers see after placing an order.  
This is the final step in the checkout flow showing order success and next steps.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/checkout/confirmation.html` – Order success page
- Order number display, success message, order summary
- Action buttons (View Orders, Continue Shopping)
- Celebration design with checkmark animation

This completes **all Task 4 UI wireframes** and creates the UI foundation for Task 13 (Checkout confirmation).
