# Task 4 – Subtask 4.2: Admin Dashboard UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **Admin Dashboard UI** – the main control panel for platform administrators.  
This page shows statistics, quick actions, and links to manage sellers, categories, and orders.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/admin/dashboard.html` – Complete admin dashboard
- Dashboard cards showing key metrics (total users, sellers, orders, revenue)
- Quick action buttons for admin tasks
- Professional layout matching your base template design

This creates the UI foundation for Task 8 (actual Admin Dashboard functionality).
