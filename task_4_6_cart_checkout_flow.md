# Task 4 – Subtask 4.6: Cart & Checkout Flow UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **Cart & Checkout UI** – the shopping cart and checkout review pages.  
These are the final steps in the customer shopping journey before placing an order.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/cart/view.html` – Shopping cart summary page
- `Development/templates/checkout/review.html` – Order review and address selection
- Cart item management (quantity, remove, subtotal calculation)
- Checkout form with address selection and order summary

This creates the UI foundation for Tasks 12-13 (Cart Management & Checkout functionality).
