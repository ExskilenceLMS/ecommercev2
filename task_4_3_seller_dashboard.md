# Task 4 – Subtask 4.3: Seller Dashboard UI

## 1. Goal of this task

In this task, you will create the **Seller Dashboard UI** – the main control panel for store staff/sellers.  
This page shows seller-specific statistics, product management links, and order handling options.

By the end of this task you will have:
- `Development/templates/seller/dashboard.html` – Complete seller dashboard
- Dashboard cards showing seller metrics (total products, orders, revenue, low stock alerts)
- Quick action buttons for seller operations
- Professional layout matching your design system

This creates the UI foundation for Task 9 (actual Seller Dashboard functionality).
